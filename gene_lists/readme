mgi_essential --> 2454 MGI Mouse essential genes, obtained from McArthur lists: https://zenodo.org/record/6724346#.YzW4TtJBwlU DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6724346. Essential in mice | 2,454 | Genes where homozygous knockout in mice results in pre-, peri- or post-natal lethality. The mouse phenotypes were reported by Jackson Labs [[Blake 2011]], then essential gene list was extracted via manual review of phenotypes by [[Georgi 2013]], and the essential/non-essential flag was put into dbNSFP [[Liu 2013]]. We extracted the genes from dbNSFP. | [[Blake 2011], [Georgi 2013], and [Liu 2013]] |
